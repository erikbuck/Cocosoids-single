# Cocosoids

This is a simple Python 3 [Cocos2D](https://github.com/los-cocos/cocos) single player "Asteroids" style game. It was created as a sample for Wight State University's "Game Programming" course that I teach.

Cocosoids-single_python3 is a simple "Asteroids" style game implemented in two files, Game.py and CommonLayers.py plus two reusable utility files that are not specific to Cocosoids, KeyboardInputLayer.py and GameSprite.py. Start the game with the Game.py file.
